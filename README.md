STLCC VIRTUAL TOUR
works with Health122.sql database

The C# tic tac toe game and the java guessing game that are unlocked when a user completes the tour are experimental
If you download it and try to run the app those links on the index.jsp page will probably not work.

I think it has to do something in the windows registry to work. Ill test it on a another computer and put up a video of how to set that up so that links to the application files of the C# game and the java game work. But to get it to work does involve running the CustomURLProtocol application  where the user types in the Protocol Name Company and clicks the Browse button to find the two applications that are locted in the dist folder for the java app which is somewhere inside the GuessingGame_starter folder and for the c# app tic tac toe app the app  is located in the Debug folder somewhere inside the TicTacToe Michael Mueller IS 153 674 folder.

The CustomURLProtocol application which I did not write it was from source code I downloaded from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/332206/Custom-URL-Protocol-for-Invoking-Application the application is in the Debug folder which is somewhere inside the Custom URL Protocol involes a app folder
